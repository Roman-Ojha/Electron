-> Electron automatically generate it application as per system platform
-> There is a two type of software we can build
    1) Executable/Installable
    2) SDK
        -> No need to install
-> yarn add -D electron-builder
-> on package.json:
    -> "main": "./src/23_Build/main.js",
        "scripts": {
            "build": "electron-builder"
        },
-> yarn build
-> Note this will build the SDK not Installable
